The main task of this coursework is to create a program in C that is able to read data from a file and plot an ASCII histogram using that data.

The program accepts 2 arguments: a .hist file and a .txt file.

The .hist file must be formatted to be 2 numbers (can be floats) per line, while the .txt file can be any body of text. Sample files are attached.

A report that explains the design decisions behind the program is also attached.
