The main task of this coursework is to create a program in C that is able to read data from a file and plot an ASCII histogram using that data.

A report that explains the design decisions behind the program is attached.

## Requirements
- A computer
- Console

## Usage
1. Download the .exe and open your preferred console.
2. Run the file and pass 2 arguments to it: a .hist file and a .txt file.

e.g. `histogram input.hist input.txt` 

The .hist file must be formatted to be 2 numbers (can be floats) per line, while the .txt file can be any body of text. Sample files are attached.
